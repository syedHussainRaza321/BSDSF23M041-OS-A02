This is a hands-on project that takes you deep into the workings of a core Unix utility:
ls. Starting with a basic C implementation, you will incrementally add advanced features, mirroring
the capabilities of the standard ls command in a GNU/Linux environment. This project is designed
to strengthen your understanding of file systems, system calls, and the professional practices used to
build robust command-line tools.

The goal is to move beyond basic programming and master the design and implementation of
system-level software. You will learn to parse command-line options, manage file metadata, format
output professionally, and manage the project's evolution with a disciplined Git workflow, including
versioned releases for each new feature.

What I did , 
• System Call Programming: Using essential system calls like stat(), lstat(), readdir(),
getpwuid(), and getgrgid() to interact with the file system.
• Data Structures & Algorithms: Using dynamic arrays and standard library sorting
algorithms (qsort) to manage and present file system data.
• Command-Line Argument Parsing: Implementing logic to handle command-line options
such as -l and -R.
• Output Formatting: Crafting detailed, column-aligned, and colorized output similar to
professional command-line utilities.
• Build Automation: Using a Makefile to manage the compilation and build process of your C
application.
• Professional Git Workflow: Using branches for features, and creating versioned tags and
releases on GitHub.
